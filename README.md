# lirc_api
A REST API for remotely invoking LIRC's irsend command.

This is only supposed to be called on a secure LAN as no security of any kind has been added.

This API will work with the nadRemote APP to simulate a NAD 705 Remote control. This REST API is supposed to run on a machine
with LIRC installed and configured with a remote called NAD. And the machine must have a IR transmitter attached.
